Running the Program

  argument, the csv file. Enter the following in the command line to run the program: python budget.py budgetfile.csv

Interpreting the Output
-You will see results such as Expenses by category, Analytics for {month}, and Analytics for {location} in a dictionary, where the key is the category of spending, and the 
value is the aggregate amount spent in that category. You will also see a recommendation statement based on your spending habit (if income is greater than expenses and vice
versa).
